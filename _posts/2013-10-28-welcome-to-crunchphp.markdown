Actually this site doesn't serve any deeper purpose. I own the domain and I have
some free space. Also it allows me to get into [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com) for static site generations.
While playing around -- it took me the promised 5 minutes to set it up --
I wonder why I've not started with it earlier, because lets get honest: Most
pages _are_ static. So here I am: An slightly ugly looking page with the simplest and
easiest "blog-system" I've ever seen. That may be an interesting start point for another
attempt of an english speaking blog (for those who know me and/or just speak german:
My heavily outdated [German blog](http://www.kingcrunch.de) is still available). With
code highlighting, images and such I have all I need. However, the domain doesn't fit that
good, because an English language blog with a German .de-domain? I should be a more
"international" one I guess. Hopefully this wont be my last blog post.
