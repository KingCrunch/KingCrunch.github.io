    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Sebastian Krebs, a software engineer from Berlin.</p>
    <p>This blog covers topics around programming and development, as long as I find
        time to blog about it. I loosely contribute to several projects like
        Doctrine, Symfony and many, many small ones. My primary interests are
        software architecture and system infrastructure.</p>
    <p>I started programming back in 1998. I started studying physics in 2004, which
        I swapped against information science in 2006. In 2011 I began working with
        web applications.</p>
